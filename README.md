# Chicago-Car-Crash-Data
Phase 3 Project
## Overview
Accidents occur everyday and injuries are unfortunately part of the process. For this project, we will analyze data of car crashes in the Chicago are and determnine what factors make the accident go from a minor paint job to and injury or even fatal accident. 

## Data
The data being studied will be reduced to 9 features which we believe to be easy to understand by anybody caring to view this project and its findings. 

## Models

The Models used will be Logistic Regression for our baseline, Random Forests untuned and then Random Forests with SMOTE to help with the intense imbalance in our target variable. 

## Conclusion

It can be seen from the data analyzed that features such as crashing on the front-right side of the vehicle as well as accidents that occur while changing lanes, have a higher tendency to cause and injury.
